## UX Design



### Agile Development
I used the Agile methodology for the management of this project. 
- I utilized 'Issues' functionality on GitHub  to create user stories.

- They were then organized into epics, stories, and tasks.

- I used the Kanban Board to visualize and manage tasks throughout the project lifecycle.

- Additionally, I used MoSCoW Prioritization to categorize and prioritize requirements.

*(Remark: this was my first encounter with Agile and MoSCoW methodologies. I tried to implement them as taught during the CI course, dividing tasks into Must Have (up to 60%), Should Have, and Could Have (both up to 20%). However, due to my limited experience, I slightly overestimated the project scope. As a result, I had to make adjustments along the way, and most of my tasks ended up falling into the Must Have category. I'll keep that in mind for my future projects.)*
