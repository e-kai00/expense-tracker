## UX Design

My intention was to keep the design clean and minimalist, prioritizing simplicity and ease of use of the app. The interface features a straightforward layout with intuitive navigation, allowing users to quickly manage their expenses. The design elements are kept minimal to avoid clutter and distractions. 

### Color Scheme
The color scheme for this project is designed to be simple and clean, using two primary colors from the [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/color.html) framework and shades of grey for fonts. 

![Palette](/readme-img/design/palette.png)

The primary colors used are:
- Teal Accent-4 (#00bfa5): this vibrant teal color adds a refreshing and energetic touch to the project,
- Red Lighten-1 (#ef5350): the red color provides an eye-catching accent and mainly used for buttons.

In addition to the primary colors, shades of grey are used for fonts to ensure readability. 
In overall, I aimed to create a visually appealing, harmonious and user-friendly interface.


### Icons

[Materialize](https://materializecss.com/icons.html) and [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- To enhance the visual appeal and usability of the project I used icons from two popular icon libraries: Materialize and FontAwesome.

### Typography

Two [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used for the app:
- Merienda - used for logo and page headings
- Quicksand - used as default

### Wireframes

I did initial sketches with paper and pencil and then created more detailed wireframes for desktop and mobiles using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). You can find all of the wireframes for this project in [design](https://github.com/e-kai00/expense-tracker/tree/main/readme-img/design/wireframes) folder. <br><br>


### Agile Development
I used the Agile methodology for the management of this project. 
- I utilized 'Issues' functionality on GitHub  to create user stories.

![Agile cards](/readme-img/agile/agile5.png)

- They were then organized into epics, stories, and tasks. 

![Agile epic](/readme-img/agile/agile.png)

![Agile task](/readme-img/agile/agile4.png)

- I used the Kanban Board to visualize and manage tasks throughout the project lifecycle.

![Kanban board](/readme-img/agile/agile2.png)

- Additionally, I used MoSCoW Prioritization to categorize and prioritize requirements.

![moscow method](/readme-img/agile/agile1.png)

*(Remark: this was my first encounter with Agile and MoSCoW methodologies. I tried to implement them as taught during the CI course, dividing tasks into Must Have (up to 60%), Should Have, and Could Have (both up to 20%). However, due to my limited experience, I slightly overestimated the project scope. As a result, I had to make adjustments along the way, and most of my tasks ended up falling into the Must Have category. I'll keep that in mind for my future projects.)* <br><br>

### Features to Implement

**Update User Profile**
- Enable users to change their password, email and delete their profile.

**Manage individual transactions**
- Allow users to delete or modify their recorded transactions.

**Income categories** 
- Provide the ability to create income categories, offering the same functionality as expense categories.

**Create and manage accounts (e.g., Cash, Cards, Savings)**
- Allow users to create and switch between different accounts. I initially planned to include this feature right from the start, but due to my limited experience and time constraints, I had to postpone it. For now I leftÂ the `AccountCategory` model unused in my app and plan to return to implement it. <br><br>
