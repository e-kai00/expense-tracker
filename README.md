## UX Design



### Agile Development
I used the Agile methodology for the management of this project. 
- I utilized 'Issues' functionality on GitHub  to create user stories.

- They were then organized into epics, stories, and tasks.

![Agile task](/readme-img/agile/agile4.png)

- I used the Kanban Board to visualize and manage tasks throughout the project lifecycle.

- Additionally, I used MoSCoW Prioritization to categorize and prioritize requirements.

*(Remark: this was my first encounter with Agile and MoSCoW methodologies. I tried to implement them as taught during the CI course, dividing tasks into Must Have (up to 60%), Should Have, and Could Have (both up to 20%). However, due to my limited experience, I slightly overestimated the project scope. As a result, I had to make adjustments along the way, and most of my tasks ended up falling into the Must Have category. I'll keep that in mind for my future projects.)*

### Features to Implement

**Update User Profile**
- Enable users to change their password, email and delete their profile.

**Manage individual transactions**
- Allow users to delete or modify their recorded transactions.

**Income categories** 
- Provide the ability to create income categories, offering the same functionality as expense categories.

**Create and manage accounts (e.g., Cash, Cards, Savings)**
- Allow users to create and switch between different accounts. I initially planned to include this feature right from the start, but due to my limited experience and time constraints, I had to postpone it. For now I leftÂ the `AccountCategory` model unused in my app and plan to return to implement it.
